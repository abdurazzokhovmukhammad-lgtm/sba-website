      <h2>SBA - Singular Bio Art</h2>
      <p>SBA is born from half your thought and half the mind of artificial intelligence. It cannot be changed. This is what makes it unique. One of a kind in the world.</p>
      <p>Each SBA receives a unique digital identifier â€” from 0 to infinity. The smaller the number, the rarer the artifact. This means time works against you: the earlier you create your SBA, the more valuable it will be.</p>
      <p>SBA is not just a digital image. It is proof of your thought, transformed into art. It is a symbol of your exclusivity and elitism.</p>
      <h3>Why is SBA exclusive?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>One artifact = one idea, permanently preserved.</li>
        <li>No copying or forgery is possible.</li>
        <li>A unique ID guarantees authenticity and rarity.</li>
      </ul>
